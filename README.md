<h1>Stop Watch Mini Project</h1>

This was created in reference to JS Mini Project 1 requirement.

I have used html, css and vanila javascript.
Html file : index.html
css :  stopwatch.css
Javascipt:  stopwatch.js

The code renders a stopwatch on modern browsers with three control buttons.

The three contorl buttons are start, stop reset.

<h2>Variables in JS file</h2>
hours = hr
Minutes = min
Seconds  = sec
stoptime : boolean flag to check if stopwatch is stopped or not

<h2>Functions used</h2>
**Function startTimer** :   fucntion to start timer when 'Start' button is clicked.
**Function stopTimer** :  fucntion to stop timer when 'stop' button is clicked
**Function timerCycle** : TimerCycle() is called after every 1000ms (1 sec) using setTimeout.
If seconds are more than 60, minutes become 1 and seconds 0.
Similarly if minutes are more thant 60, hours become 1 and minutes 0.
**Function resetTimer** : fucntion to reset timer when 'reset' button is clicked
